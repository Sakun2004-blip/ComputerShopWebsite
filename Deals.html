    <h5 class="Sub-topic">1.Discount</h5>
    <p class="para">On the Deals page, one of the most crucial elements to showcase is Discounts. Customers are always drawn to products that offer them better value for their money. You can include percentage-based discounts (e.g., “Save 20% on all gaming laptops”) or flat-rate discounts (e.g., “$50 off on desktop computers”). It is important to clearly display the original price vs. the discounted price so that visitors can immediately see the benefit. Discounts can also be applied to both hardware and software products, giving a wide range of options for different types of customers. Highlighting the discounted items with bright badges or labels, such as “Hot Deal” or “Save Now,” can help attract attention and increase conversion rates</p>
      <h5 class="Sub-topic">2: Special Offers</h5>
    <p class="para">In addition to standard discounts, the Deals page should include Special Offers that add extra value to the customer’s purchase. This could include bundle deals, such as pairing a laptop with a wireless mouse and keyboard at a lower combined price. Free add-ons like extended warranties, software packages, or accessories can also be considered special offers. Seasonal or festival offers—like Back-to-School promotions, Black Friday sales, or New Year discounts—can create excitement and urgency. Displaying these offers prominently, often with eye-catching banners or cards, makes customers feel that they are getting a unique opportunity that won’t last long</p>
      <h5 class="Sub-topic">3.Flash Sales and Limited Time Sales</h5>
    <p class="para">Another important component of the Deals page is Sales, particularly Flash Sales or Limited-Time Sales. These are temporary promotions that encourage immediate action by creating urgency. For example, you could have a “24-Hour Laptop Flash Sale” or “Weekend-Only Deals on Tablets.” Countdown timers are highly effective on this type of sale, as they visually remind customers that the deal is temporary. Highlighting limited-stock items with labels like “Only 5 Left!” or “Hurry! Limited Quantity” can motivate customers to make faster purchasing decisions</p>
      <h5 class="Sub-topic">4.Clearance and Last-Stock Items</h5>
    <p class="para">The Deals page is also a great place to feature Clearance items or Last-Stock Products. These are products that are either being replaced with newer models or are part of your remaining inventory. By clearly labeling these as “Clearance Sale” or “Last Chance,” you provide customers with an incentive to buy before the item is gone. Often, these products can be offered at deeper discounts, which further increases the appeal of the Deals page. Presenting these items in a separate section or visually distinct cards helps users quickly navigate and identify high-value bargains.</p>
      <h5 class="Sub-topic">5.User Friendly Features</h5>
    <p class="para">Finally, the Deals page should include user-friendly features to help visitors quickly find what they are looking for. Filters and categories allow customers to sort deals by product type, brand, discount percentage, or price range. Adding search functionality ensures that users can easily locate specific products on sale. Additionally, a newsletter signup section or “Exclusive Deals for Members” can encourage repeat visits and customer loyalty. Visually, using product cards with clear images, pricing, discount labels, and “Buy Now” buttons makes the page more interactive and appealing, ensuring that users engage with the deals effectively</p>
